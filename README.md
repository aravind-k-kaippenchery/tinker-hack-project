# [Project Name] GrabemNumbers

### Project Description
GrabemNumbers is a gloriously useless calculator where keys float like balloons, and you “click” them by pinching the air using hand gestures. tpe in an equation? Get roasted by AI. Nail it? Enjoy a Rickroll. Built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, Google Mediapipe for hand tracking, and Gemini API for insults.
